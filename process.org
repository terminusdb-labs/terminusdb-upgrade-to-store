* Converting

The old terminus-server kept ttl files of every new layer, the positive and negative plane.
This makes it pretty easy to load the triples with rdf_read_turtle/3, without having to use
hdt itself.

Steps:

1. Ensure that the DB dir exists (check it by looking for prefix.db)
2. Traverse through the database directory
3. Read every positive plane and negative ttl from the graph dir and add/remove them
   with terminus-store-prolog accordingly
4. Copy the prefix.db?

Is this it?
